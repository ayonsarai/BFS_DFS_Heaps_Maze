 * In this assignment, you will implement a Breadth First Search (BFS),Depth First Search (DFS) and Heaps algorithms to solve a maze.*/

/* Breadth First Search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. 
Queue data structure is used to implement BFS for finding the shortest path in an unweighted maze.

Depth First Search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. 
Stack data structure is used to implement DFSfor exploring all possible paths in the maze.

Heaps are a type of binary tree that satisfy the heap property. Heaps are used to implement Heap (Priority Queue) for finding the shortest 
path in a weighted maze (Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm).  */
